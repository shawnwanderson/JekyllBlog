## [Binder](https://mybinder.org/)

Binder uses GitHub and Docker to allow you to host your [jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) in the cloud! Where anyone can run them for themselves.

You can see my binder here: https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/LinuxIsCool/binder/master

## How to create your own binder
1. Create a GitHub repo called 'binder' or whatever you want.
2. Follow the instructions on the Binder website.
