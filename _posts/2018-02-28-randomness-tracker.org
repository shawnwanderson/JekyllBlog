* Randomness Tracker
An app that tracks your random field.

** How it works
*** You install an app on your phone which will generate random numbers, at random intervals.

*** random distributions defined by random parameters. Formally:

*** Random parameters that randomly change at random intervals

*** Your generated sequence of numbers is tracked, as is the deviance of this sequence. 
On average, how different is the average from the expected average?

*** You can easily visualize how unusual your random field has been performing.

*** Observe a chart, x=time, y=unlikeliness

*** Observe a chart, x=time, y=variance

*** Observe a chart, x=time, y=deviance

** Implementation
*** JS React
*** Google FireBase
*** JS Visualization (Echarts/D3)
