I graduated with a CS degree in April 2016. Since then I have been working at home. I do contracting work with django/python. I plan on attending graduate school at Simon Fraser
University in Vancouver starting September 2017. I spend just about all my free time striving to become a better software engineer and data scientist.

### More Information

Other interests include lifting, yoga, music, cooking, and spending time with my girlfriend.
