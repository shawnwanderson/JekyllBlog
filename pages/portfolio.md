[(Intro) Blockgeeks workshop: AI in Cryptocurrency Markets - August 2019](https://youtu.be/deMINRPtLa8)

This is a workshop tutorial on how to use machine learning to build profitable AI
trading systems in cryptocurrency markets. Thanks to Bhaneeta for introducing me
to the great team at blockgeeks.com

[Data Scientist at RBC Amplify 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU8z5yiRKF4)

My team won the award for most disruptive internal solution with our product Bundle. Bundle
solves access management in the bank by leveraging machine learning to produce optimal access packages
bases on patterns in existing access data. For this solution we used matrix factorization, clustering,
network modelling, and d3.js for visualizations. The video portrays me as a designer, but I was of course a data scientist.

[Buy Bitcoin Edmonton]() - I have since lost the domain for this and lost track of the source code RIP:

I made the following website as an outline for a business idea I had in Fall 2016, something along the lines of Cryptocurrency investment consulting firm. The idea is that if you could have a physical store front where customers can come in and purchase a very simple crypto-investment plan, similar to mutual funds at the bank, then you tap into a large demographic of people which are marginalized from the crypto-investment space due to inadequate internet navigating skills.

When I first moved to Vancouver in May 2017, I was continuously bombarded by a stream of art and artists. I became imbued with the mystic energy which resonates here. An energy emerging from the ocean and reverberating about the mountains. An energy felt, and altered by all beings which has inhabited this geolocation, past and present. In this natural enclave, the people are inadvertantly possesed by spirits and demons of both gayan and cosmic nature. In this shamanistic state of traversing the rich ether of Vancouver, I felt a compulsion to join the artists, to manifest my subjective experience into an artifact which can be preserved, shared, and studied by all of posterity. Behold, that artifact which captures my experience of May 2017, My first month of living in Vancouver British Comumbia:
